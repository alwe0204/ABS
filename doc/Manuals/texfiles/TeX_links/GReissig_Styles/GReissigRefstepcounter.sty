%%%%%% generalization of \refstepcounter, p@equation
\def\refstepcounter#1{\stepcounter{#1}%
    \protected@edef\@currentlabel
       {\csname p@#1\endcsname{\csname the#1\endcsname}}%
}
%\csname  the#1\endcsname was put between braces in order to allow
%the user to define \p@foo as a function, e.g. \def\p@equation#1{(#1)}.
%However, the old form remains applicable, e.g. \def\p@equation{Equ.~}
%is still working.

% \ref should take care of as much as possible:
% we do NOT need \eqref anymore:
\def\p@equation#1{(#1)}
\def\p@table#1{Tab.~#1}
\def\p@figure#1{\iflanguage{german}{Abb.~#1}{Fig.~#1}}
% we do not permit using \eqref, just use \ref instead:
\let\eqref\@undefined
