% Define \bstctlcite if not yet defined; needed for classes other than
% IEEEtran.cls and ieeecolor.cls:
\ifx\bstctlcite\undefined
% From IEEEtran.cls:
% Provide support for the control entries of IEEEtran.bst V1.00 and later.
% V1.7 optional argument allows for a different aux file to be specified in
% order to handle multiple bibliographies. For example, with multibib.sty:
% \newcites{sec}{Secondary Literature}
% \bstctlcite[@auxoutsec]{BSTcontrolhak}
\def\bstctlcite{\@ifnextchar[{\@bstctlcite}{\@bstctlcite[@auxout]}}

    \edef\@citeb{\expandafter\@firstofone\@citeb}%
    \if@filesw\immediate\write\csname #1\endcsname{\string\citation{\@citeb}}\fi}%
  \@esphack}
